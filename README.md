# This is the Project of the Beeterdata website. 
### I have used the Selenium automation tool with Java language to write automation scripts.
### I have created 2 test scripts
1. Verify the data source upload functionality
2. Verify the data source comparison with the original file
### To create test scripts, I have used the Page Object Model and TestNG frameworks.
### I have used OOPS concepts of Java such as Inheritance, Abstraction, Class, and Objects.
### I have created a TestNg .xml file to run the test scripts.
